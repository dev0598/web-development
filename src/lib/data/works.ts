        subtitle: "Non-Invasive. Radiation-Free. Intelligent Screening for a Healthier Tomorrow.",
        description: "In healthcare, timing is everything ‚Äî especially when it comes to cancer. Early detection not only increases survival rates but also reduces the burden of treatment and cost. Yet across the world, access to early cancer screening remains uneven, with many communities still relying on invasive, radiation-based tests that are often expensive or inaccessible. ThermalLook aims to rewrite this story.\n" +
            "ThermalLook is a next-generation thermal imaging solution powered by artificial intelligence, designed to detect cancer at an early stage ‚Äî safely, non-invasively, and affordably. Using a high-sensitivity thermal camera, the device captures subtle heat variations across the body, identifying patterns that may indicate abnormal cellular activity long before symptoms arise. The AI engine, trained on medical-grade datasets, analyzes these thermal patterns in real-time, flagging early signs of cancers such as breast, head and neck, lung, and prostate ‚Äî all without the use of radiation or physical contact.\n" +
            "What sets ThermalLook apart is its simplicity and versatility. It doesn‚Äôt require large diagnostic centers or complex infrastructure. It can be deployed in hospitals, mobile screening camps, rural clinics, or even community health drives. The device is compact and portable, yet powerful ‚Äî enabling health workers to screen dozens of people in a short amount of time, with instant, interpretable results.\n"+
            "Beyond cancer, ThermalLook is opening new possibilities in preventive and post-care healthcare. Its applications extend to monitoring inflammation, circulatory disorders, physiotherapy progress, and post-surgical recovery. Researchers and clinicians also benefit from its ability to track thermal changes during drug trials and treatment interventions, giving a new dimension to real-time, data-driven care.\n",
